# digital-VLSI-design-course
DVD course projects that cover the physical design of integrated circuits (chips) from the logic design through the physical implementation until fabrication (RTL2GDS). It was achieved through lab sessions that were carried out on a real system-on-chip example using state-of-the-art EDA tools in a commercial nanoscaled process technology.
