Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 65nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including TQuantus, IQuantus and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(extract_rc_cap_filter_mode option of the set_db) is 'relative_and_coupling' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for post_route extract_rc_effort_level low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(extract_rc_effort_level option of the set_db) in post_route extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 39 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.
*info:     3 net(s): Could not be fixed because buffering engine can't find a solution.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Dumping Information for Job 377 **WARN: (IMPESI-3014):	The RC network is incomplete for net lp_riscv/placement_opt_inst_FE_OFN1180_n_9209. As a result, a lumped model will be used during delay calculation which may compromise timing accuracy. To resolve this, check parasitics for completeness, re-extraction may be required.

*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 35 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because buffering engine can't find a solution.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Slew Violations
-------------------

Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1098.650,1998.500), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.



**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.

  Found a net with slew violations that have been marked as don't touch. 
  CCOpt will not be able to fix these violations directly.
  Consider removing the don't touch flag: {dbSet [dbGetNetByName net].isDontTouch 0}.
