Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 65nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including TQuantus, IQuantus and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(extract_rc_cap_filter_mode option of the set_db) is 'relative_and_coupling' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for post_route extract_rc_effort_level low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(extract_rc_effort_level option of the set_db) in post_route extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

=======================================================================
                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 36 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because buffering engine can't find a solution.

*info: Total 1 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 1 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.
