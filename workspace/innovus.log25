Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 65nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including TQuantus, IQuantus and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(extract_rc_cap_filter_mode option of the set_db) is 'relative_and_coupling' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for post_route extract_rc_effort_level low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(extract_rc_effort_level option of the set_db) in post_route extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Slew Violations
-------------------

Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1.500,1188.220), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.



**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

=======================================================================
                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 35 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because of exceeding max local density.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 4 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.

*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 34 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    33 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

**ERROR: (TCLCMD-1130):	The '-late' and '-early' options to the report_timing_summary command can only be specified together when the timing system is in simultaneous setup and hold mode. You can use 'set_global timing_enable_simultaneous_setup_hold_mode true' to enable this mode for timing analysis only. All non-timing commands are disabled while the system is in simultaneous setup/hold mode. Ignoring '-early' and using '-late' alone.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Slew Violations
    -------------------
    
    Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1.500,1188.220), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.
    
    
    
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Slew Violations
    -------------------
    
    Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1.500,1188.220), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.
    
    
    
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Slew Violations
    -------------------
    
    Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1.500,1188.220), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.
    
    
    
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Slew Violations
    -------------------
    
    Found 2 slew violations below the root driver for clock_tree CLK at (1.500,1188.220), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net PAD_CLK which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net} with half corner wc_dly_corner:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin PAD_CLK with a slew time target of 0.250ns. Achieved a slew time of 0.304ns.
    
    
    
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-2237):	More than half the existing clock gates in the netlist are cells that cannot be used by CTS because of the clock tree setup. This suggests that the clock tree setup is wrong, or at least inconsistent. You should check the clock gate setup to make sure it is correct.
